```console
$ cd proto/
$ buf generate
```

## Project goals

* Code something
* Practice Go
* Do something with protocol buffers and gRPC
* Make a fun game to play with my wife
* Maybe play with Dagger, but definitely GitHub actions and infra-as-code

### Incidental goals

* I guess I should pick up JS and React again
* Set up an easy dev environment with docker-compose
* Oh look, I need to use Envoy to make grpc-web work
* `protoc` and plugin management are annoying, `buf generate` with remote plugins are a nice find
